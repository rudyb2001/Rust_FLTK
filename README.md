# Rust_FLTK
Rust projects using FLTK

I got the idea from this website about different GUIs for Rust:
https://dev.to/davidedelpapa/rust-gui-introduction-a-k-a-the-state-of-rust-gui-libraries-as-of-january-2021-40gl#fltk

I have extremely limited experience with Rust, and for some reason this code only works with the version fltk = "^0.10" in the Cargo.toml file, which I don't really understand at all.  When I try using the later versions like fltk = "^1.2", it doesn't recognize any of the objects from the library. I am not sure why that is something.

It seems like FLTK is mainly used for extremely small-scale applications like app launchers and other highly specialized tools/apps. It doesn't seem to have many capabilities beyond just displaying text and images. It does have 3D graphing software, but I don't have any ideas for using that in any way.
